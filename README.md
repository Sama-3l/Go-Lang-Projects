   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sama-3l/Go-Lang-Projects.git

2. Navigate to the project you are interested in:
   ```bash
   cd Go-Lang-Projects/project-name

3. Follow the project-specific README or code comments for setup and usage instructions.
   ```bash
   cd Go-Lang-Projects/project-name

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Golang installed on your system.
- For projects involving databases, set up the necessary database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Refer to each project's README for specific requirements.

## How to Run

Follow these steps to run each project:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```

2. Execute the following command to run the project:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

3. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:port` (replace `port` with the specified port in the project, and will be displayed in the console).
